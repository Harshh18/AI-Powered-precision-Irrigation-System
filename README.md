## Problem statement
Automatic regulation of valves for release of water based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the crop, using artificial intelligence, in a piped and micro irrigation network of irrigation system.

## Our solution
This system employs artificial intelligence to continuously assess soil moisture levels around crops. When the soil becomes too dry and requires irrigation, the AI triggers the (Solenoid) valves to release water precisely where and when it's needed. This ensures efficient water use, reduces waste, and promotes healthy crop growth. It's a smart solution for sustainable and automated irrigation management.

## Approach to the solution
The approach involves utilizing artificial intelligence to monitor soil moisture levels within the crop's root zone in a piped and micro-irrigation network. When the AI detects that the soil is sufficiently dry, it autonomously regulates the irrigation valves, releasing water precisely where and when it's needed. This intelligent system optimizes water use, minimizes wastage, and supports healthy crop growth by ensuring that irrigation is provided only when necessary.
